# Data Manipulation
A comparison of [Base R](https://www.r-project.org/),
[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org),
[data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/),
and (maybe) python's pandas for data manipulation.

Each directory contains examples for common data manipulation tasks using
different dialects.

NOTE: all the example scripts are exptected to be evaluated from the project
root directory.
